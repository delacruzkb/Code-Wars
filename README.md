# CodeWars-Practice

## What is this repo:
A place where I post my solutions to the various training challenges that CodeWars has to offer with the hopes to display my current level of programming proficiency.

## What is CodeWars:
A place to train in a selected programming language by writing code to a presented situation/problem.
CodeWars then runs your code through various tests they made before hand.
Each Kata has different difficulties, so each problem has its own intricacies.

## CodeWars Definitions
- Kata : Real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.

- Kyu/Dan Ranks : Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.
